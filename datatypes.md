## C++ Data Types: Type, Bit Width, and Range

| Type | Typical Bit Width | Typical Range |
|---|---|---|
| int | 4 bytes | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned int | 4 bytes | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| short | 2 bytes | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| unsigned short | 2 bytes | 0 to 65,535 |
| char | 1 byte | -128 to 127 (signed) |
| unsigned char | 1 byte | 0 to 255 |
| long | 8 bytes | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| unsigned long | 8 bytes | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |
| long long | 8 bytes | -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup> - 1   |
| unsigned long long | 8 bytes | Same as unsigned long |
| float | 4 bytes | Approximately 1.8 x 10<sup>-38</sup> to 3.4 x 10<sup>38</sup>  (single-precision) |
| double | 8 bytes | Approximately 2.2 x 10<sup>-308</sup> to 1.8 x 10<sup>308</sup> (double-precision) |
| long double | 8, 10, or 16 bytes | Implementation-defined range (typically extended double-precision) |
| bool | Implementation-defined | 0 (false) or 1 (true) |
| void | N/A | Represents the absence of a type or value |
| wchar_t | 2 or 4 bytes | Wide character, typically used for Unicode characters |
